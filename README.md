### Synopsys Paves The Way For The EDA Industry With Its New AI tools


## Overview and Origin
# Synopsys, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNPS)

Synopsys, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNPS) specializes in (EDA) electronic design automation and supplies tools and services to the semiconductor design and manufacturing industry. They are a highly profitable business that is publicly traded on NASDAQ and the S&P 500 with Revenues of $5.8 billion dollars and an operating income of $1.27 billion dollars as of 2023.  It was founded in 1986 by Aart de Geus, David Gregory and Bill Krieger and became public in 1992, but we are focusing on when they launched their commercial AI tools. This first AI driven tool was released in 2020 with DSO.ai. This was followed up wit a full-stack approach for chip designs in March 2023, called Synopsys.ai. Synopsys.ai copilot was launched shortly after in November 15, 2023.  To add to the understanding of leadership during this time only recently did COO Sassine Ghazi succeed Aart de Geus as CEO as of January of 2024. Also I will list out the names and positions of the original team that lead the development of DSO.ai, which won the ASPENCORE World Electronics Achievement Award for Most Innovative Product of 2020. This team I believe is important because they were able to launch the first AI powered product of their entire industry with such great success that they competitors now offer similar products and has now became of large focus of Synopsys itself. This team attributed the Idea of this project to being inspired by AlphaGo, the computer program that, in 2016, taught itself how to play the game of Go and went on to defeat human experts.

## Business Activities

	Chip design challenges main contributors are time and money with developments costing hundreds of millions of dollars and exponentially increases for smaller more complex chips, and thus with the implementation of DSO.ai this should reduce development time, lower costs, improve yields, and enhance performance.  DSO stands for Design Space Optimization which is an approach of searching large design spaces enabled by recent advancements in machine learning. Chip design has an exponential amount of possible solutions which requires a lot of heavy intense labor efforts, usually taking weeks of experimentation guided past experience. Thus DSO.ai uses reinforcement-learning technology to autonomously search design spaces for optimal solutions. They DSO.ai program was used by Samsung with great success and their new Synopsys.ai is currently being utilized by Microsoft, Intel, and AMD.   
 
	They have the broadest portfolio of application security testing tools and services while also being the  leaders in the electronic design automation (EDA) and semiconductor IP, thus they have a large array of customers and services they offer to satisfy their customers.  The advantages they offer starts with the scale and scope of the company. The EDA industry is oligopolistic with Synopsys holding 32.14% of the market share with their closest competitor being Cadence with a 23.4% share followed by Siemens with a 14% market share. These market shares are from 2020 before Synopsys released its new AI products, which has likely increased their market share. Synopsys claims that its DSO.ai was the industry's first autonomous AI application for chip design, which was met with great success and now they are the first to offer a full-stack approach with their newly launched AI-Driven EDA suite. This product was awarded the 2023 World Electronics Achievement Award for Best Product of the Year, showcasing that they are on the forefront of integrating AI into chip design. Cadence their closest competitor now offers similar AI products as well with their first AI product launched in 2022 a year after Synopsys, and then its latest AI product in 2024 resembling Synopsys.ai launched in 2023. Due to the shier size and recourses these company have they all engage in strategic acquisitions allowing them to increase their market shares, capabilities and overall portfolios. This acquisitions can also reinforce the trend of this industry engaging in AI solutions with the types of companies being purchased.
	
	The technologies that they are currently using are DSO.ai, VSO.ai, TSO.ai which now offered in their new full stack product Synopsys.ai or Synopsys.ai Copilot which uses the generative AI(GenAI) that is fed by Synopsys resources such as product user manuals, application notes, video and any documentation found on the Synopsys SolvNetPlus support community.  it will work within the confines of a particular organization to give more specific and relevant results. it will continue to learn in a secure closed-loop manner to provide guidance, recommendations and create workflow scripts. This includes the use of ML(Machine Learning), RL(Reinforcement Learning), and GenAI(Generative AI). The main difference between Synopsys.ai and Synopsys.ai copilot the first is a AI suite to give AI driven solutions for the varying stages of chip design and the second assists in the design process through conversation intelligence.  The Synopsys.ai copilot program has partnered with Microsoft to integrate Azure OpenAI Service to compliment the Synopsys AI tools. 
	
## Results

	They are currently revolutionizing the chip design industry which they have already been a leader in for a number of years.  They continue to gain massive partnerships and clients such as Samsung and Microsoft, whilst winning a number of awards for every new AI product they release.  The success of these new AI chip design programs has solidified their continued success, and has allowed the technology industry as a whole to keep progressing at its current pace with the potential for more exponential growth. This is reinforced by a number of metrics that we can use to measure the success of EDA companies. First Technology innovation, which again, Synopsys was the first to market with its new AI products setting the trend for need for more AI products in this industry. Another metric of their success, partnerships and collaborations. As stated before they are working with elite technology leaders such as Microsoft, Intel, and AMB with the addition of the acquisition of Ansys. Also previously stated was their market share compared to their other two largest competitors which they currently lead in as well. Finally their financial performance is another easy metric to gage their success with. They have continually shown growth in this metric and it is reflected by their stock price as well.

## Recommendations

	This company pretty much does it all when it comes to the EDA industry and them some by offering a range of tools and services along with partnering with other leaders in the industry.  This makes it hard for an outsider to suggest any improvements or extra services they could offer, but with this being said, I believe the lack of transparency and communication on their services could be the improvement itself.  This could be accomplished by adding more free trials to their AI suite that would allow smaller business or any potential customer to get a better understanding of the products. They could also build a public user forum to give more insight into their products, and finally they could offer educational courses and tutorials to make the concepts and technical workings of their AI suite more obtainable by outsiders. 
	This accessibility of more in-depth knowledge of their products would reach an even more wide range of customers then they are currently targeting. To be fair, they do hold a large market share in their industry and have built a brand and reputation that sells itself, but with AI being such an explosive an new industry, making information on their products more readily available could help the access new incoming customer bases that weren't previously known or targeted.  This solution would also benefit them with even more customer feedback on their products, which is data that can then be fed into their modules that utilize ML, RL, and GenAI. They could possibly integrate this data into their already existing hybrid AI programs or create specific programs to handle this data separately. These types of programs usually benefit from having larger more accurate data pools, which is great reason to implement multiple different platforms for their customers to interact and give feedback, to improve the results of any data they are trying to analyze using AI tools.
